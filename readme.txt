1- Prior to executing the program, it is imperative to download and put two files,
 namely ResNet50_Classifier h5 and yolov3 weights, and subsequently place them within 
 the designated Models folder.
YOLOv3 weights : https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
Face Mask Classifier ResNet50 Keras Model : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jupSKiJ_ngJYQmXA4cpur_KZGgUud3dA?usp=sharing

2- Subsequent to the execution of the program, the next step entails the running of 
the make_film.py script in order to generate a video file.

As part of the process, it is required to modify the contents of two files, 
namely make_film.py and main.py, by substituting the existing path with the designated path.
